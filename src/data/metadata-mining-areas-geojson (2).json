    "description": "GeoJSON file. This is a dataset of possible mining areas in Myanmar  that was digitized from a systematic search of high-resolution imagery available on Google Earth and Bing Aerial.   Digitizing took place in late 2015 and early 2016 with the most recent imagery available (usually 2014 or 2015).   A field in the attribute table called \"Certainty\" indicates the how confident we were that the digitized polygon is a mine, rather than some other type of ground disturbance.",
